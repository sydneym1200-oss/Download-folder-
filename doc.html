  <p>
    Appearing a bit pompous at times, this self-appointed lead of the group has a habit of getting
    his words and ideas mixed up. Easily befuddled, Doc's spectacles often slip a little too far
    down on his nose as his words often tend to get mixed up. Overly gracious and highly efficient
    in his own mind until an important decision is necessary and his nerves take over, preventing
    any relevant decision from being made. A little nervous, Doc never seems to know what to do with
    his hands.
