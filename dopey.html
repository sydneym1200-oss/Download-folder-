  <p>
    This loveable, slightly-balmy, child-like fellow gets a great kick out of life. Imbued with a
    sense of fun, he is a bit like Harpo-Marx, in that Dopey doesn't speak, but his sly grin seems
    to 'tell all.' Dopey's garments are at least 5 sizes too big for him, but that only adds to his
    charm. Somewhat mischievous, Dopey somehow manages to capture the hearts of everyone.
