    He sees the world through half-closed eyes and always seems to be talking through a yawn.
    Perpetually nodding off, Sleepy could easily recline anywhere to get some sleep. A rare talker,
    when he does have something to say, it is always straight and to the point - even though he's too
    tired to know it.
